<h1>About Me - Rob Peterson</h1>
<p>I am a long time resident of Las Vegas, along with my wife and three grown children. I have an invested interest 
  in technology, especially assistive technology which is my current occupation. HTML is more recent interest, as I 
  have picked this up within the last year or so. I am currently developing my programming skills, and am on track 
  to earn an associate's degree in software within the next couple of semesters.
